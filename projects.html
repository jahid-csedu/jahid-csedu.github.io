                <p class="para">Embark on a journey through my key projects, where I've harnessed technology to create
                    impactful
                    solutions. In the Rakuten Beauty project, I contribute as a dynamic Backend API Developer, enhancing
                    user experiences in the realm of beauty salons across Japan. The Electronic Voting System, a
                    blockchain-based initiative, showcases my prowess in refactoring legacy codes and improving user
                    experiences. Kona Time To Throw Away, a waste management system in South Korea, witnessed the
                    development of a recycling collection scheduling API. Lastly, at TechnoNext, I led a team in
                    crafting a sophisticated flight search mechanism as part of an advanced Airlines Reservation System.
                    These projects reflect not just my technical skills but a commitment to innovation that leaves a
                    lasting impact.

                <h2>NewzGator</h2>
                <p><strong>Duration: Jul 2025 – Present</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.newzgator.com" target="_blank">NewzGator</a> is a personal project where I designed 
                    and implemented the entire <strong>backend system</strong> for a news aggregation platform 
                    focusing on Bangladeshi newspapers. The system ingests, cleans, classifies, and clusters thousands of 
                    articles daily, delivering structured news data for further use by the frontend and other services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project emphasizes <strong>real-time content updates</strong>, ensuring readers receive fresh news 
                    directly from verified Bangladeshi news sources. A key technical challenge was designing the system to 
                    efficiently crawl, process, and redirect news content while maintaining <strong>SEO-friendly URLs</strong> 
                    and ensuring compliance with Google News indexing standards.
                </p>

                <p>Key backend contributions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automated Crawling & Scraping</strong>: Built custom crawlers to fetch articles from 
                        multiple Bangladeshi news sources with fault tolerance and retry mechanisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning & Deduplication</strong>: Implemented pipelines to normalize content, 
                        remove redundant/unused data, and handle duplicate articles efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>News Classification (NLP)</strong>: Integrated a fine-tuned <strong>BERT model</strong> 
                        to automatically categorize news into 15+ segments such as Politics, Business, Sports, and Technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>News Clustering</strong>: Developed a <strong>distance matrix–based algorithm</strong> 
                        to group similar articles across different sources, improving information diversity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalable Serverless Architecture</strong>: Deployed backend workflows using 
                        <strong>AWS Lambda, S3, SQS, and DynamoDB</strong> to handle ingestion and processing with 
                        minimal operational overhead.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Throughput Processing</strong>: Optimized batch jobs and asynchronous pipelines 
                        (Spring Batch + Kafka) to process thousands of articles daily.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement <strong>end-to-end backend pipelines</strong>, 
                    apply <strong>machine learning for real-world classification tasks</strong>, and leverage 
                    <strong>cloud-native serverless architectures</strong> for scalability.
                </p>
