                <p class="para">Embark on a journey through my key projects, where I've harnessed technology to create
                    impactful
                    solutions. In the Rakuten Beauty project, I contribute as a dynamic Backend API Developer, enhancing
                    user experiences in the realm of beauty salons across Japan. The Electronic Voting System, a
                    blockchain-based initiative, showcases my prowess in refactoring legacy codes and improving user
                    experiences. Kona Time To Throw Away, a waste management system in South Korea, witnessed the
                    development of a recycling collection scheduling API. Lastly, at TechnoNext, I led a team in
                    crafting a sophisticated flight search mechanism as part of an advanced Airlines Reservation System.
                    These projects reflect not just my technical skills but a commitment to innovation that leaves a
                    lasting impact.

                <h2>NewzGator</h2>
                <p><strong>Duration: Jul 2025 – Present</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.newzgator.com" target="_blank">NewzGator</a> is my personal project, designed and developed 
                    from scratch to serve as a modern news aggregation platform focusing exclusively on Bangladeshi newspapers. 
                    The platform collects, processes, and publishes the latest news articles across multiple categories including 
                    politics, business, sports, education, entertainment, technology, and lifestyle. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project emphasizes <strong>real-time content updates</strong>, ensuring readers receive fresh news 
                    directly from verified Bangladeshi news sources. A key technical challenge was designing the system to 
                    efficiently crawl, process, and redirect news content while maintaining <strong>SEO-friendly URLs</strong> 
                    and ensuring compliance with Google News indexing standards.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some of the major highlights of NewzGator include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automated Content Aggregation</strong>: Developed custom crawlers and ingestion pipelines to 
                        fetch articles from multiple Bangladeshi newspapers in near real-time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Google News Integration</strong>: Implemented specialized <code>news-sitemap.xml</code> 
                        feeds with proper schema to enhance visibility on Google News and Top Stories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart Categorization</strong>: Articles are dynamically categorized into 15+ segments 
                        (Politics, Sports, Education, Technology & Science, Business & Economy, etc.), improving navigation and discovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance & Scalability</strong>: Designed backend services with caching (Redis), 
                        asynchronous message queues (Kafka), and optimized database queries for handling thousands of 
                        articles efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>SEO & Indexing</strong>: Implemented canonical tags, structured metadata, robots.txt, 
                        and sitemap index strategy to maximize search engine discoverability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: Optimized for both mobile and desktop with a clean, 
                        user-friendly interface focused on content readability.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    As a member of the development team, I worked on the <strong>backend development</strong> of the project — from system design, 
                    backend development, database design, and data collection using crawling and scrapping, data cleaning, deployment and monitoring using serverless architecture.
                    The platform is currently live at <a href="https://www.newzgator.com" target="_blank">https://www.newzgator.com</a>.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Python, BERT Classifiers, AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, AWS API Gateway, Google Search Console</p>
