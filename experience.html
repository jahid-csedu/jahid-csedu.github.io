                    commitment to engineering excellence.</p>

                <p>At Sonali Intellect Limited, I started as a Junior Consultant, earning recognition for optimizing
                    PLSQL
                    scripts, reducing report processing time by 25%. Transitioning to Kona Software Lab Limited, I
                    delved
                    into blockchain services, contributing to impactful projects like the Electronic Voting System and
                    Kona

                    automating
                    the loan application process.</p>

                <p>Currently, as an Applications Engineer at Rakuten Group, I'm a dynamic Backend API Developer

                <p>Dive into the captivating realm of the Rakuten Beauty project, where I don the hat of a dynamic
                    Backend API Developer, adding layers of innovation to a longstanding production initiative. This

                    monitoring protocols.
                </p>

                <p>Within our tight-knit team, we've embraced a philosophy of complete ownership, transcending the

                <p><strong>Jun 2022 – May 2023 | Dhaka, Bangladesh</strong></p>
                <p>As a key player in the Blockchain Business Unit Department, I assumed the role of a Senior Software
                    Engineer, steering the backend service team through uncharted territories. Our mission was clear –
                    to deliver cutting-edge blockchain-based services that harmonize seamlessly with the intricate web
                    of chain code. Powered by Java-based services and the Spring Boot framework, our backend system
                    became the engine of innovation.
                </p>

                <p>My contribution extended to two impactful projects that stand as pillars of achievement: The
                    Electronic Voting System, a beacon of democracy designed for diverse voting events, and Kona Time To
                    Throwaway, a holistic waste management system touching lives through waste collection, awareness
                    campaigns, and innovative reward management.
                </p>

                <p>These projects, now operational, serve the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of users. As a
                    Senior Backend Developer, my responsibilities went beyond coding. Client communication, solution
                    design, ongoing support and maintenance, and task delegation to a dynamic team of developers were
                    all part of the orchestration.
                </p>

                <p>In the labyrinth of legacy projects, I upheld a commitment to excellence, ensuring clean and
                    readable code that stood the test of time. Navigating the intricacies of code cleanliness,
                    refactoring outdated bases, reviewing business logic, and eliminating duplications became a
                    testament to my dedication. Spearheading major refactoring and business modifications, I
                    successfully orchestrated transformations without encountering a single hiccup.

                <p>During my tenure at TechnoNext, I assumed a pivotal role in shaping the technological backbone of an
                    advanced Airline Reservation System. This bespoke system was meticulously crafted to empower
                    airlines, streamlining the management of flight schedules, passenger reservations, agent oversight,
                    OTA management, and an array of critical functionalities.
                </p>

                <p>As a Senior Software Engineer, I spearheaded the development of robust backend APIs using Java
                    Spring Boot and associated frameworks, all intricately woven into the fabric of a microservices
                    architecture. In the capacity of a team leader, I took charge of a dynamic team comprising 4 to 5
                    developers, fostering an environment of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement.
                </p>

                <p>One of the team's remarkable achievements was the development of a critical feature – a
                    sophisticated flight search mechanism. This feature seamlessly responded to diverse search criteria,
                    offering tailored results based on user types, whether a regular user, an OTA, or a travel
                    agent.
                </p>

                <p>In close collaboration with the senior architect, I played a crucial role in designing a scalable
                    and highly available system. Our collective efforts were dedicated to ensuring the robustness and
                    adaptability of the system, catering to the dynamic needs of the ever-evolving airline industry.

                <p>Embark on a transformative journey through the corridors of Sonali Bank Limited, where my role as an
                    Assistant Programmer transcended the conventional boundaries of a developer. In a project ethos that
                    championed the spirit of a "One Man Army," I delved into every facet of the Software Development

                <p>My primary focus revolved around the Audit Automation System, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at
                    revolutionizing audit operations by streamlining the collection of pre-audit data from branches. The
                    data sets gathered played a pivotal role in empowering the Internal Control and Compliance Division
                    to generate comprehensive reports on branch operations across various timelines – be it daily,
                    weekly, monthly, or quarterly.

                    the intricacies of the procurement process for a myriad of IT devices, navigating through tender
                    submissions and the meticulous management of Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC).
                </p>

                <h3>Loan Origination System</h3>
                <p>Recognizing the pivotal role of loans within the bank's operations, a strategic decision was made to
                    automate the intricate loan application process. As a core team member steering this automation
                    initiative, my contributions went beyond conceptualization to hands-on development of fundamental
                    operations for the Loan Origination System. This endeavor played a crucial role in simplifying and
                    expediting the often complex and authorization-intensive loan processing workflow.

                    process.
                </p>

                <p>Functioning as a support engineer, I played a pivotal role in delivering top-notch end-user support,
